1. I believe that prescriptive programming is much more readable. It is easier
   to follow what the code is doing step-by-step and comments can be placed to
   denote important steps.
2. Prescriptive programming is easier for me to implement because I just have to
   think about the order of steps I need to take and then write those down. For
   each function where we had to do a prescriptive and functional
   implementation, I always did the prescriptive implementation first and then
   thought about how to translate that into functional.
3. I think functional is more scalable. They tend to be much shorter and follow
   a pretty standard pattern. I think as I program more, I will be able to
   better follow and understand this pattern, but as of now it's still a bit
   confusing.
4. I prefer prescriptive for it's general readability and explicitly laid-out
   steps.
